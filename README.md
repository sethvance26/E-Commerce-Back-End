## Description
This week, our task was to configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySql database. When the user adds their information into the environment variable file, they can connect to their database using Sequelize. When schema and seed commands are entered, a database is created and seeded with test data. When entering in node server, the sever starts and all the models are sycned to the MySql database. When the user opens API GET routes for categories, products, or tags in Insomnia Core than the data for these routes is displayed in JSON format within Insomnia. The User can also test API POST, PUT, & DELETE routes in Insomnia Core for these routes as well!
